          My background is in building secure distributed systems&mdash;from
          bare metal racked up in a data center running Linux, Windows, and
          FreeBSD to cloud platforms that securely connect vehicles, ships, and
          airplanes owned by the United States Government.

          I started with economics and statistics, but then found networks and
          computers much more interesting. My first encounter with cloud
          infrastructure was when I had to create a financial model for a global
          network of data centers. Today, that global network is better known as
          Microsoft Azure.

          At Fix, I&rsquo;m usually the first line of support for customers. I
          ask a lot of questions about your existing security stack and the
          compliance frameworks you need to track. Since I come from the cloud
          warehouse space and analytics engineering, I look at security data as
          just another data source that needs to be centralized and visualized
          in a dashboard.

          Before Fix, I was an Apache committer and the technical lead for
          Marathon, a highly available cluster scheduler for container
          orchestration for Apache Mesos. I also built the trip execution and
          vehicle dispatching system for MOIA, Volkswagen&rsquo;s ride pooling
          service.

          At Fix, I lead a team of engineers in creating the building blocks of
          our service. This includes creating a search syntax that enables
          intuitive searching and traversing of our security graph without the
          hassle of a learning a complex graph query language. I also ensure
          that our unified data model works across all resources for{' '}
