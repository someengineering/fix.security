        What is <abbr title="Cloud Security Posture Management">CSPM</abbr>, and

        <p>
          Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) helps maintain the security,
          compliance, and operational efficiency of your cloud infrastructure.
          Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between cloud
          providers and their customers:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>
              Security <em>of</em> the cloud:
            </strong>{' '}
            Cloud providers are responsible for the underlying network and
            infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Security <em>in</em> the cloud:
            </strong>{' '}
            Customers are responsible for the data they store, access policies
            and regulatory compliance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Adherence to security and compliance policies determines a
          company&rsquo;s security posture, and it is the customer&rsquo;s
          responsibility to perform the necessary checks.{' '}
          <abbr title="Cloud Security Posture Management">CSPM</abbr>{' '}
          standardizes and automates these checks.

  },
  {
    question: 'How does Fix work?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Fix creates snapshots of your infrastructure&rsquo;s resource
            inventory at regular intervals.
          </strong>{' '}
          The data collection process is comparable to an{' '}
          <abbr title="Extract, Load, Transform">ELT</abbr> pipeline, a widely
          recognized approach in cloud security referred to as &ldquo;agentless
          scanning.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Fix Collectors</strong> harvest configuration data for each
            individual resource via cloud provider APIs and send this data to
            Fix Core.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fix Core</strong> stores metadata in a graph-based inventory
            and provides APIs to query and update the graph.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The graph contains a complete representation of all resources and
          their relationships. By combining security data with these
          connections, Fix identifies potential pathways to a security breach.
          This empowers security engineers to pinpoint critical risks in their
          infrastructure.

  {
    question: <>What is included in a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of my cloud?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>
            A cloud snapshot is a complete representation of your cloud
            infrastructure that includes all components and
            configurations&mdash;compute instances, storage buckets, serverless
            functions, etc.
          </strong>{' '}
          Snapshots not only list resources, but also capture the relationships
          and connections between resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The significance of snapshots lies in their non-invasive nature when
          it comes to conducting security assessments. With snapshots, you avoid
          direct interactions with your live production environment, minimizing
          any potential disruptions.

  {
    question: 'Which cloud providers are supported?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Fix currently only supports <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>
        , but we&rsquo;re working on rolling out support for Kubernetes, Google
        Cloud, Azure, and DigitalOcean.

  {
    question: 'How does Fix connect to my cloud?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Fix requires read-only API access to the cloud accounts you wish to
            monitor and secure.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Manually maintaining these permissions is a tedious task, so we
          provide a CloudFormation template that automatically creates a role
          with the required permissions and a trust that allows a specified{' '}
          <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> account to assume this
          role.
        </p>
      </>

  {
    question: 'How does Fix protect my data?',
    answer: (
      <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>
          <strong>
            Fix does not access the actual data stored on your storage volumes
            or buckets.
          </strong>{' '}
          Fix operates without an agent, only reading the configuration data of
          your cloud resources via cloud provider APIs. This approach allows Fix
          to scan for and identify security vulnerabilities and
          misconfigurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Fix also utilizes an isolation concept known as workspaces to
            organize and secure your data.
          </strong>{' '}
          When you create a Fix account, a workspace is created specifically for
          you. You have the option to invite others to join your workspace, but
          by default only the owner of a Fix workspace can view its data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Additionally, Fix allocates a dedicated database for every
            workspace.
          </strong>{' '}
          Data pertaining to your workspace is stored in a database exclusively
          for your use, rather than being commingled in a shared database with
          other Fix customer data. This architecture not only segregates
          customer data (enhancing privacy), but also mitigates a range of
          security vulnerabilities associated with shared databases, such as SQL
          injection attacks.
